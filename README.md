“Bengalathon” is a technology based competition in which computer programmers and others involved in software development, including graphic designers, interface designers and project managers, collaborate intensively on software projects. This event will be an opportunity for the engineering students/technical professionals/ common citizens to become aware of IT applications and contribute to ideas or prototypes that will help shape the long-term policies of the government. Additionally the citizens will be more receptive to new IT initiatives being rolled out in future as they will be the actual contributors of those ideas. Government of West Bengal is looking forward to active participation from the students/ technical professionals/common citizens to come up with their own ideas and solutions, and play the support role for channeling the entrepreneurial energy in the right direction in order to become a formidable player in the technology domain in the future.


Objective: The purpose of “Bengalathon” is to achieve the following objectives using some of the leading practices like series of awareness building or training workshops in the weeks leading to the event:

Recognize innovative ideas that would culminate into path-breaking viable solutions for any of the industry sectors or citizen services
Provide a platform to showcase the innovative skills/ideas of the state resources at the national and international arena
Encourage and promote innovations to create an appropriate entrepreneurial environment in the state
